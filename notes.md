## October 26, 2025

* Got the website looking a bit better...
* Made showcase/demo videos for site.
* Ordered UV sensor + driver board.
* Worked on configurations for future prototypes-migrating from RPi.
* Need to study for exams while waiting for parts!!!

## October 25, 2025

* Filed provisional patent application.
* Published GitHub website for Ember/Cedaris.
* Updated notes structure and layout for tracking ongoing work.
* Need to work on brand image and trademark
* Worked on trying to get the camera I bought to work... after extensive testing I've concluded MISO is stuck high. In my earlier attempts I must've carelessly connected to 5v or something. Another camera (more compatible) can be found on amazon and will be bought today.
* The solar blind UV bulb I want is expensive and needs supplemental hardware. I worked with a simple 8x8 thermal array and a temperature threshold to determine flame latency/detection time.
* The 8x8 is almost completely irrelevant for actual use cases at distance, but might as well continue working though concepts while parts come. The 8x8 only works to about 5 inches in low light and 6 at high light, but generally averaged about a half second, from flame to alert, which if I can replicate with UV at distance I would be pretty pleased.

## October 24, 2025

* Meeting with AI Professional @ Schwab:

  * Advised reading *Million Dollar Weekend* and starting quickly.
  * Emphasized quantifying demand and preorders.
  * “AI demand > people who know AI.”
  * Encouraged launching publicly before perfecting product.

* Scheduled Purdue Incubator meeting.
* Finalized provisional patent and drawings.
* Prepared for filing and payment.
* Realized drawing process improved product definition.
* Created GitHub website and continued developing provisional package.

## October 23, 2025

* Applied to Purdue Incubator (awaiting feedback).
* Realized Ember would fail to send alerts during electrical fires if Wi-Fi is down.
* Dropped thermal sensor from MVP due to redundancy and battery limits.
* Brainstormed no-Wi-Fi hub concept:

  * “Ember Hub” device to relay alerts to datacenter and EMS.
  * Decided it’s probably unnecessary for MVP but could be a future add-on.

* Model after Ring’s business strategy:

  * Define problem Ember solves.
  * Prioritize ease of installation and minimal friction.
  * Plan to expand sensors after core product is proven.
  * Focus on brand image, RR is good, but I do not want to monetize alerts.

* Began work on marketing copy, website setup via GitHub, and continued provisional filing prep.

## October 21, 2025

* Hardware prototyping:

  * Decided prototype should start with Raspberry Pi, later migrate to custom industrial-grade board.
  * Considered part tradeoffs (e.g., R13192 vs. R9533 for cost).
  * Planned to finalize design specs, including PCB fab possibilities.

* Market research planning (“ask people: how much would you pay?”).
* VC vs. non-VC funding considerations.
* Realized current hardware costs for prototype may reach ~$500+ (UVTRON, IMX678, etc.).
* Decided wireless approach preferred over wired integration.
* Planned to explore battery feasibility through interrupt wake logic.
* Books to read: *Prototype to Product*, *The Hardware Startup*.
* Contacted Purdue Innovates for potential support.

## October 20, 2025

* Patent strategy thoughts:

  * Focus patents on technology that supports customer experience.
  * Prioritize provisional filings that stack logically.
  * Build around the “why customers love the product.”

## October 19, 2025

* Worked on provisional patent (UV + Thermal + CV sensor system).
* Considered Purdue IP resources and clinics.
* Patent naming brainstorm: *EMBR*, *Ember*, *Aember*, *EmberSense*.
* Noted: Provisional only protects what is explicitly included; claims in conversion app must be supported.
* Considering trademark intent-to-use filing; specimen can be submitted later.
* Deferred full patent filing until clearer prototype and specs.
* Concept development: Tri-model fusion (CV + IR + Thermal).
* Strategy:

  * Wait to file as long as possible.
  * File before public disclosure.
  * Focus current effort on prototyping instead of filing.

* Evaluated production costs and hardware feasibility.

  * Current idea: UVTRON + CV + IR sensors.
  * Privacy considerations (“no big brother” vibe).
  * Desired on-device CV processing.
  * Began thinking about battery capacity, range, and component layout.

* Questioned need for electrical engineer; decided to progress prototype independently for now given capital limitations.
* Bought MQ gas sensor; planned to begin bookkeeping.

## October 18, 2025

* Could not get Arducam to work (bought Pico version by mistake).
* Got smoke detector with beeper working.
* Planned: Market research and design refinement for trademark.
* Decided to focus more on thermal sensor work.
* Considered UV sensing but deemed it not viable versus IR.

## October 17, 2025

* Began prototyping phase.
* Tested thermal sensor (working, but requires extensive testing).

## October 16, 2025

* Planned updates: Secretary of State, IRS, and business license.
* Generated Operating Agreement.
* Began outreach

## October 15, 2025

* Named Cedaris Technologies LLC (derived from "Cedar" + Latin suffix).
* Filed initial LLC paperwork.
* Initial list of managers.
* Drafted Operating Agreement.
* Planned to open business account (Mercury, Relay, Novo, or local).
